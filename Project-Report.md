*PROJECT REPORT*

About/Purpose
    I first came up with the idea behind Code Clicker when I realized the simplicity of Cookie Clicker. Not that Cookie Clicker is easy to make, but rather that it was all happening right in the browser. There were no external applications running - it was all written out in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once I realized that, I started thinking, "Wait, I could make my own game like this!" So yes, Code Clicker is very heavily inspired by Cookie Clicker, but it isn't looking to compete with the game (as that would be a Hurculean task). Instead, I saw Code Clicker as an opportunity to learn how to make webpages. Considering how, in my college at least, web development isn't taught until Sophomore or Junior year, I saw this project as a way to get ahead of the curve a little. I set out to learn the basics of making a complete webpage, and I'd argue that, with all the variables and functionality behind my game (which is still just a website), I went even beyond this. In October, when I was still planning out the game, I knew nothing about JavaScript or CSS, with only basic HTML knowledge. Now, at the end of November, I am confident in creating new sections in HTML, organizing them to add images next to text, using flexbox and many other CSS attributes, and handling semi-complex backend data management with JavaScript. So, in essence (and regardless of whether I like/enjoy the game or not), the project has been a success. 

Development/Learning
    I learned everything about how to make this website on my own - that is, without any college courses. The main resources I used were W3 Schools, freeCodeCamp, knowledgeable friends, and AI. I won't hide it: AI was used in the making of this game. But rather than use it to make the game, I used it to help ME make the game. In reality, my AI usage mostly went like this: Question about why something wasn't working -> explanation by AI -> expanded knowledge of how HTML/CSS/JS work. For example: "why is this paragraph element so spaced out?" -> "Paragraph and Header elements naturally have line-spacing and margins above and below them." -> Using this knowledge in the future when adding other parts that use headings/paragraphs (like the hover textboxes). With that out of the way, onto how I actually learned independently. I got into a routine of doing a lesson or two a day, whether that be on any one of the three languages. I would read a W3 Schools or freeCodeCamp article on a topic, take notes, play around with it in the editor, then apply it to my game. It was quite fun, actually. Being able to first learn something then immediately after apply it felt very satisfying.  Towards the beginning, my work on the game was mostly learning-based, and towards the end it shifted to mostly development-based as I already knew how to do most of what I wanted. Yet again, this is a sign of a successful project: transitioning from learning to do something to being confident enough to actually do it.

Challenges
    The largest challenge I faced was my own planning. Towards the end of development, I began shifting away from learning concepts in advance to learning them as I face them, which I now see as a mistake. Trying to both grasp a topic and apply it at the same time was not always easy, and left me frustrated not a few times. Instead, when I tackle another project in the future, I will do a lot more experiemnting. I know from experience that I learn best through playing around with something. So, when I instead try to jump right into game development without having a chance to plan and fully grasp the concept, I don't execute as well and feel more pressure. Instead, in the future, I might create a "play" file on the GitHub, where I'm free to experiment with all the new ideas I'm learning. For example, when adding the bit icon to the prices of the managers/upgrades, I struggled a lot. I couldn't wrap my head around adding images alongside text, because I never took any lessons on it. I was learning as I went, which didn't work out great in the moment. Instead, in the future, I'd instead first take a day or two to make a mockup website with some images, getting comfortable with the idea before implementing it in the game. Aside from this idea, however, there were no major challenges - the project was fun!

The Future of Code Clicker
    Though this is the first release of Code Clicker, I'm sure there will be future updates. The game will no longer be my primary focus, but I'm sure updates will come out regularly. Not because I feel as though I have to, but instead, like I said before, because developing the game is simply fun! I still have a few ideas to implement that are a bit more advanced than what I'm familiar with, so be on the lookout. Code Clicker will never reach the same complexity as Cookie Clicker, but it doesn't need to. I'm still not a game developer after all, just a curious computer science student. For now, I'm happy with how the game has turned out. I've even had some friends play it, and they say they enjoy it as well! And if a video game is enjoyable, then I'd say it's doing its job quite well. Project success!
